My name is Deborah Famadas Rodriguez. Here are some interesting things about me:

I am originally from Bejucal, Mayabeque, Cuba, but I am currently living in Havana. I am in my 3rd year of Computer Science at the Matcom faculty at the University of Havana, Cuba. In my free time I enjoy learning and programming. I have some extracurricular studies in the Software Engineering branch. You can find me on telegram as @dbyta.

I identify myself as: A concerned, sufficient and dedicated person. I like to get right into the things I do and I believe that people are capable of whatever we set our minds to. I love to hear constructive criticism of my work and how I can improve, and I consider myself all the time learning, which I love.

I like to work in languages like: Javascript, python, and declarative languages like Prolog and Haskell, in which I have some experience.
